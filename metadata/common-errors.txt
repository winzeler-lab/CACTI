Chemical Analysis and Clustering for Target Identification - CACTI tool

The constructed open-source annotation and target prediction tool explores chemical and biological public databases, mining these to obtain a thorough report on common name, synonyms, structurally similar molecules, in addition to chemical clustering analysis against validated drug-targets. Below, are common errors and strategies to overcome them.

Controller errors
C1 -- FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'XXX.log'
Error meaning: Output folder does not exist.
Solution: Confirm correct output path was provided, or create the output folder/subfolders prior to executing CACTI.

Module 1 (synonyms, literature) errors
L1 -- Error: HTTP failure: 500 // or related time-request error 
Error meaning: Time out request. This occurs when the amount/frequency a request is performed to the databases exceed their maximum request limit.
Solution: Increase the sleep size (getLiterature.py), or split the input query file into two+ files.

L2 -- pj.getBindingDB(smiset[i],1.0) // or related database
Error meaning: Database inaccessible
Solution: At times, databases cannot be accessed and processes get interrupted abruptly. To resolve this, 1) uncomment the "data.to_csv()" function (getLiterature.py) to write line-by-line report for large scale query sets, 2) increase sleep size (see L1), or 3) try at a later time

Module 2 (analogs) errors
A1 -- Can't kekulize mol.
Error: Invalid SMILES in query set
Solution: 1) Provide correct SMILES (indicated in the log file), or 2) remove said SMILES from analysis

A2 -- pj.getChemblSimilPerc(smiset[i],1.0) // or related database
Error meaning: Database inaccessible
Solution: Similar to (L2); increase sleep size (getSimilarCompounds.py), or 2) try at a later time

A3 -- requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='XXX', port=XX):
Error meaning: Time out request. This occurs when the amount/frequency a request is performed to the databases exceed their maximum request limit.
Solution: 1) Increase the sleep size (getSimilarCompounds.py), 2) split the input query file into two+ files, or 3) comment block of database exceeding limits and run at a later time

Module 3 (clustering) errors
CC1 -- ValueError: Length of values does not match length of index
Error: Invalid SMILES in query set
Solution: See (A1) solution
